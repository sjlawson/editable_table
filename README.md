Thanks to Joel Rodrigues for his tutorial on MrBool.com

This is my take on the editable table problem and is essentially a fork of the code found in Rodrigues's article at:
http://mrbool.com/how-to-create-an-editable-html-table-with-jquery/27425

I've made a few improvements to make the style of the input elements more closely match the static table cells. Also, I've also added JSON strings in a 'rel' attribut on the cells, which makes the actual save process possible.
